	Use generating functions to find the number of ways to choose a dozen bagels from three varietiesegg, salty, and plainif at least two bagels of each kind but no more than three salty bagels are chosen.

	 _Hint_: Look at the coefficient of $x^r$ in both sides of $(1+x)^(m+n)=(1+x)^m (1+x)^n$.
][
	We use $[x^k] F(x)$ to represent the coefficient of $x^k$ in the generating function $F(x)$. Then

	In how many ways can seven different jobs be assigned to four different employees so that each employee is assigned at least one job and the most difficult job is assigned to the best employee?
][
	We just ignore the restriction "the most difficult job is assigned to the best employee" firstly. Then we can discuss of the distribution of jobs among employees:

	(1) ${4,1,1,1}$, $n_1=binom(7,4,1,1,1) binom(4,1,3) = 840$.

	(2) ${3,2,1,1}$, $n_2=binom(7,3,2,1,1) binom(4,1,1,2) = 5040$.

	(3) ${2,2,2,1}$, $n_3=binom(7,2,2,2,1) binom(4,3,1) = 2520$.
	
	Consider that the most difficult job has an equal probability of being assigned to each employee, which is $1"/"4$. So the number of ways that the best employee take the most difficult job is
	$
	1/4 (n_1 + n_2 + n_3) = 2100
